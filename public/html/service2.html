<div class="pb-sm-2 font-weight-bold">Advanced parametric modeling / 3D modeling of MEP services</div>
<p>We use advanced software for parametric model development and BIM modelling. Our team will create a BIM model of your building taking into consideration all utility systems, design and architectural features of fa√ßades as well as interior design. It will allow defining possible collisions and undesired intersections of elements at the stage of design work rather than at the construction stage when it is harder to resolve them.</p>
<p>With the help of advanced cloud services of project development and storage, you will have an opportunity to follow the process of design work online (i.e. drawings, cooperation with partners and contractors, introduction of corrections and comments).</p>
